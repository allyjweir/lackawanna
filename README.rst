------------
- Upload, store and view research evidence (text, audio, video, PDFs)
- Retrieve webpages in their entirety and store them for later viewing
- Create multiple transcripts for datapoints
- Annotate transcripts and datapoints
- Full text search of datapoints, annotations, projects, collections, transcripts and tags

Standout Features (for developers)
-------------
- Designed with *extensibility* in mind
- Built using best practices with *documented* code
- Easy to deploy (with Heroku)
- Flexible *open source license* (BSD)

Development
----------
Lackawanna uses Vagrant to simplify the creation of a reliable development environment. You can find a 'Getting Started' development guide in the docs/ directory in the repository

Deployment
----------
Please follow the deployment guide within the docs/ directory in the repository.

Contribution
----------
This project is fully open source so if you have suggestions or improvements please create an issue or make a pull request!
Settings
------------


lackawanna relies extensively on environment settings which **will not work with Apache/mod_wsgi setups**. It has been deployed successfully with both Gunicorn/Nginx and even uWSGI/Nginx.

For configuration purposes, the following table maps the 'lackawanna' environment variables to their Django setting:

Getting up and running
----------------------

The steps below will get you up and running with a local development environment. We assume you have the following installed:

* pip
* virtualenv
* PostgreSQL

First make sure to create and activate a virtualenv_, then open a terminal at the project root and install the requirements for local development::

    $ pip install -r requirements/local.txt

.. _virtualenv: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/

You can now run the usual Django ``runserver`` command (replace ``yourapp`` with the name of the directory containing the Django project)::

    $ python yourapp/manage.py runserver

The base app will run but you'll need to carry out a few steps to make the sign-up and login forms work. These are currently detailed in `issue #39`_.

.. _issue #39: https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django/issues/39

**Live reloading and Sass CSS compilation**

If you'd like to take advantage of live reloading and Sass / Compass CSS compilation you can do so with the included Grunt task.

Make sure that nodejs_ is installed. Then in the project root run::

    $ npm install grunt

.. _nodejs: http://nodejs.org/download/

Now you just need::

    $ grunt serve

The base app will now run as it would with the usual ``manage.py runserver`` but with live reloading and Sass compilation enabled.

To get live reloading to work you'll probably need to install an `appropriate browser extension`_

.. _appropriate browser extension: http://feedback.livereload.com/knowledgebase/articles/86242-how-do-i-install-and-use-the-browser-extensions-

It's time to write the code!!!
