CoffeeScript Note
=========

Originally the project started out with code being written in literal CoffeeScript. While a nice abstraction, it was causing a lot of issues:

1) One more tool to learn when there is a lot of other work that needs completed.
2) Jumping through hoops for minor syntactic sugar
    - I wasn't able to fully take advantage of the functional goodness without dedicating a lot of time so it became a pain
3) Translating back and forth constantly in my head was a pain
4) Future maintainability jeopardised. AnnotatorJS is currently in a total rewrite of CS to JS because the CS intimidated new contributors. If lackawanna is to survive as something others can work on it needs to be easy to approach and work on.
5) Simplicity
